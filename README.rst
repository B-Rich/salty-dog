This is the README for project 'salty-dog' (to be renamed later)
The goal of this project is to create a web enabled SaltStack 
renderer, runner and returner for managing salt nodes.

Requirements
============

The only two requirements to run this are Salt (http://saltstack.org)
and Flask (http://flask.pocoo.org).

Running
=======

To run salt-dog in development mode (which is the only mode atm), run:

# python dog.py 

and point a browser to http://localhost:5000

Get Help
========

If you need help with the salty-dog web interface, join #salt on
